## Why did you make this?

The development of SearchsBugs was driven by a desire to create a comprehensive tool for software development while learning and leveraging .NET Core and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Our primary motivations include:

1. **Learning .NET Core**: We aimed to deepen our understanding of .NET Core, taking advantage of its performance, scalability, and cross-platform capabilities to build a robust application.

2. **Embracing Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: By applying DDD principles, we focused on creating a system that closely aligns with business needs, ensuring maintainability and flexibility.

3. **Starting an Open-Source Project**: We wanted to contribute to the open-source community, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement. By making SearchsBugs open-source, we invite developers to learn from our approach and contribute to its growth.

4. **Solving Agile Process Challenges**: Inspired by the Agile manifesto, we aimed to address common process challenges in Agile project management. SearchsBugs focuses on improving collaboration, communication, and efficiency within teams, aligning with Agile principles to enhance project outcomes.

5. **Focusing on Project Management**: Recognizing the complexities of managing projects, we developed SearchsBugs to provide comprehensive project management tools. From user management to bug tracking and notifications, our goal is to streamline project workflows and improve overall productivity.

In summary, SearchsBugs serves as both a practical tool for managing development projects and a learning project for mastering .NET Core and DDD. By focusing on solving Agile process challenges and enhancing project management, we aim to create a valuable resource for development teams, with a commitment to open-source collaboration.
